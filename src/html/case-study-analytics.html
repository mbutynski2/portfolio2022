            <p class="lead">A fortune 250 IT company requested DXC to develop an application in collaboraton with a third-party firm. In my role as the UX Delivery Lead, I was tasked with facilitating design direction by outlining specifics of the UI, formalizing execution of the front-end, and facilitating communication with all stakeholders.</p>

            <p class="lead fw-thick">Goal</p>
            <p class="lead">The goal was to deliver an MVP for client beta testing in 14 weeks. A side goal was to show our client and the design firm that we are strong in development and can partner together seamlessly for future projects.</p>

            <p class="lead fw-thick">Discovery and COVID</p>
            <p class="lead">In-person workshops were quickly adjusted to virtual due to COVID. The initial launch of the opportunity consisted of 2 weeks of virtual workshops with our client, the design firm, and DXC to determine build strategy. I represented the needs of the development team from a front-end perspective and initiated deep-dive sessions based on further requirements gathering needs. Virtual working due to COVID brought about challenges in initial discovery where tools like Mural, Teams, Abstract, WebEx, Box, Slack were essential.</p>

            <p class="lead fw-thick">Design was completed and sold to shareholders before delivery team involvement</p>
            <p class="lead">Being on the delivery side of design, I gained empathy for the developers by noticing how 'concepts' presented to users that aren't vetted from a development standpoint, could cause demos and releases to underwhelm.</p>
             <p class="lead">Design files shown to the client displayed functionality unobtainable in 14 weeks where we had to be strategic in prioritizing features over styling. I addressed the extensive backlog of styling issues to allow additional resources whom could focus on the front-end styling.</p>
            <p class="lead fw-thick">UX Advocate for delivery</p>
            <p class="lead">I led the UI solution on feature execution between design, dev, and stakeholders, such as, feature parity, drag and drop, and annotations. I partnered closely with the design firm and our client to implement a tool called Abstract to better showcase the design files for development since Figma was not allowed.</p>

            <p class="lead">Due to being short staffed initially for front-end development, I stepped up to assist the team to ensure timely delivery. I coded based on styling tweaks to better align with the design mock-ups. In order to do this, I quickly completed development coursework to get up to speed on Carbon Framework and REACT. By completing this essential coursework, I formed a better understanding of Carbon Framework components and could clearly identify advantages and constraints due to client requested customizations.</p>

            <p class="lead">The stakeholders were pleasantly surprised to see DXC rise to the challenge of enhancing an internal analytics application in 14 weeks. Our client released the MVP to beta users for usability testing and feedback. I learned essential tools to access due to COVID. I also enhanced my front-end capability with a solid understanding of React, Git, Docker and furthered my skills of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
