            <p class="lead fw-medium">Overview</p>
            <p>An international aviation company would like a quick way for their flight attendants to track and record tasks. This app would enhance their existing tablet app for their flight crew. In my role as UX Design Lead, I led the discover, design, assisted development, and presented to stakeholders.</p>

            <p class="lead fw-medium">Goal</p>
            <p>The goal was to create a proof of concept of an application in 8 weeks that would allow for flight attendants to quickly perform a checklist with the hopes that it would grow over time..</p>

            <p class="lead fw-medium">Business Challenges through Design Thinking Session</p>
            <p>The business challenges revealed through the design thinking session where that Flight Attendant’s current mobile task management application needed to be enhanced to keep pace with flight schedules due to queued backlog of flight checklist activities (safety, supply, VIP passenger checks) and labor-intensive manual data entry. It was also important to mirror the airline’s brand and user experience standards with the same “look and feel” as their website booking user interface.</p>

            <p class="lead fw-medium">Translation and communication</p>
            <p>Due to language barriers, I enlisted the help of a colleague to translate the design thinking session materials from Spanish to English and recorded this meeting. Based on my previous history of working on an internal project, you never know who will be added/removed from your team at any moment. I created materials that could be easily shared with new teammates.</p>
            <p>I asked each team member what they wanted to get out of the project. This became a great ice-breaker to understand motivations and to be a support to help our teammates achieve their goals.</p>

            <p class="lead fw-medium">Discovery</p>
            <p>I was given an InVision mockup. I wanted to incorporate, but not be restricted by the design, so I used InVision freehand to create rough wireframes that could be shared by the product/sales team to aid in our UX design discussions.</p>
             <p>The scope changed after client meeting to integrate into an existing application. I requested screenshots of the current application so I could match the styles.</p>
            <p class="lead fw-medium">Design with Figma</p>
            <p>Based on these decisions, I moved to low-fidelity wireframes using Figma. This is a collaboration layout program that allows for comments, as well as code view for developers of the CSS. You can also downloaded assets directly.</p>

            <p>After this first week of focused UX design, the scope changed to feature this POC to the client and get feedback before writing code.</p>
            <p>Mirroring the design on an actual IPad showed space issues between buttons and icons as well as navigation challenges that needed to be corrected.</p>

            <p>I offered the client a closer experience by displaying the non-coded prototype on an actual tablet. By using the Figma mirroring app, anyone I share the prototype with could mirror the experience directly on the tablet.</p>

            <p class="lead fw-medium">Results</p>
            <p>We presented the app and they were delighted by the interface. We increased job satisfaction and flight efficiencies by enabling flight attendants to perform their flight checklists more quickly (IPad entry versus paper logs). We improved productivity of overall flight operations with reduction of manual data entry. We established growth potential of user experience with a scalable, tablet enriched environment for user experience (features and functions) expansion over time.</p>
