            <p class="lead fw-thick">Overview</p>
            <p>ArisGlobal's needed to modernize their current product documentation offering. Product documentation is a critical touchpoint for users to quickly get up to speed on new features and enhancements, deepen product knowledge, and allow users to self-serve thier queries to quickly complete thier goals. A company level OKR was established due to increased call volume support, customer requests, and recent losses on acquiring new business.</p>
            <p>The current documentation solution only provided in-product help and was limited in cloud-based cross-platform support. Under my leadership, our product design team was tasked to re-image how our product documentation could be offered using a new cloud-based authoring tool called <a href="https://www.madcapsoftware.com/">Mad-Cap Flare</a>.</p>

            <p>Madcap Flare is a cloud-based platform that maximizes content reuse and streamlines the creation of technical documentation and learning programs.</p>
            <p>We wanted to be able to move quickly thus leaning on the out-of-the-box templates and functionality was critical for our success. We looked through many examples to determine a template style that would adapt to our future plans of expansion and housed the most bells and whistles to present to our customers for feedback.</p>

            <p>Through evaluation of the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/help-and-documentation/">#10 Heuristic by Jacob Neilson</a> - Help and documentation content should be easy to search and focus on the user's task. Best practices say to keep it concise, and list concrete steps that need to be carried out. Here are a few of the helpful tip's we gathered from our research to inform our design.</p>
             <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure the ability to search is easily recognizable and solves customers' problems in context and immediately.</p>
              <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Ensure that the help documentation is easy to search. </p>
               <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Good frequently-asked-question pages anticipate and provide the helpful information that users might need.</p>

            <p>We took a 2 week sprint to quickly create an internal use POC that would house some of our training videos. We then got user feedback  from 5 internal documentation and service employees. The findings were incoporated into the design. Next, we shifted gears to focus our feedback requests from our customers around release notes since that would be our first area to tackle with our new portal.</p>

            <p class="lead fw-thick">Feedback</p>
            <p>We collected numerous survey's from our customers on area's we could improve our overall help and documentation focusing on the release notes. We also combed through the feedback collected from our customer success team to incorporate the main key findings around release notes. Here are the results:</p>
            <p><strong>Painpoint #1</strong> - We uncovered the main headache was the inability to search all content. Currently the primary mode of delivery was a PDF file via email. This method proved to be cumbersome with over 300 pages and lacked search ability across all releases.</p>
            <p><strong>Painpoint #2</strong> - There was also the problem of the document being out of date due to missing features, enhancements, bug fixes that were released but not updated in the PDF thus making it irrelevant. </p>
            <p><strong>Painpoint #3</strong> - Another pain point was the inorganization on how the information was displayed. There was no order among how our products structured the information thus making it appear to be randomly ordered and not grouped intuitively across all applications.</p>
