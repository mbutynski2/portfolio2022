            <p class="lead fw-thick">Overview</p>
            <p class="lead">ArisGlobal's needed to enhance their current product documentation offering. Product documentation is a critical touchpoint for users to quickly get up to speed on new features and enhancements, deepen product knowledge, and allow users to self-serve their queries to quickly complete their goals. A company level OKR was established due to increased call volume support, customer requests, and recent losses on acquiring new business.</p>
            <p class="lead">The current documentation solution only served up in-product help and was limited in cloud-based cross-platform support. Under my leadership, our product design team was tasked to re-image how our product documentation could be offered using a new cloud-based authoring tool called Mad-Cap Flare.</p>

            <p class="lead">Here are just 3 examples of the different design experiences I captured out of our 18 product offerings for product documentation. Each has their own design styles and organization of content along with limited functionality.</p>

            <p class="lead">Madcap Flare is a cloud-based platform that maximizes content reuse and streamlines the creation of technical documentation and learning and development programs.</p>
            <p class="lead">We wanted to be able to move quickly thus leaning on the out-of-the-box templates and functionality was critical for our success. We looked through many examples to determine a template style that would adapt to our future plans of expansion and housed the most bells and whistles to present.</p>

            <p class="lead">Through evaluation of the #10 Heuristic by Jacob Neilson - Help and documentation content should be easy to search and focused on the user's task. Keep it concise, and list concrete steps that need to be carried out. Here are a few of the helpful tip's we gathered from Jacob Neilson to inform our design.</p>
             <p class="lead">Tip: Make sure the ability to search is easily recognizable and solves customers' problems in context and immediately.</p>
              <p class="lead">Tip: Ensure that the help documentation is easy to search. </p>

            <p class="lead">I also collaborated with our marketing department to help with naming our new tool and provide some artistic direction so we stay in alignment with our ArisGlobal brand. I drove the final design concept we could use to gather feedback from our customer to address their top issues and incorporate the feedback as we continue to update the design.</p>

            <p class="lead">Swe took a 2 week sprint to quickly create an internal use POC that would house some of our training videos. We then got user feedback  from 5 internal documentation and service employees. The results were positive so we shifted gears to focus our feedback requests around release notes since that would be our first area to resolve with our new portal.</p>

            <p class="lead fw-thick">Feedback</p>
            <p class="lead">we collected numerous survey's from our customers on area's we could improve our help and documentation focusing on the release notes. Customer Success team feedback - we combed through the feedback collected from our customer success team to incorporate the main key findings around release notes:</p>
            <p class="lead">We uncovered the main headache was the inability to search all content. Currently the primary mode of delivery was a PDF file via email. This method proved to be cumbersome with over 300 pages and lacked search ability across all releases.</p>
            <p class="lead">There was also the problem of the document being out of date due to missing features, enhancements, bug fixes that were released but not updated in the PDF thus making it irrelevant. </p>
            <p class="lead">Another pain point was the inorganization on how the information was displayed. There was no order among how our products structured the information thus making it appear to be random ordered and not grouped intuitively across all applications.</p>

            <p class="lead">We listened to our customers and incorporated search capability along with a mindful eye on the product hierarchy and how items are organized. We wanted our users to have an intuitive experience while searching and resolving their issues in completing their goals. On a side note: once the C-level executives saw the capability of this new tool, the scope expanded to provide other services to our customers such as an Ideas Center where our customers could submit ideas and a page for our Customer Success team to manage FAQ's. We are schedule for a fall release of this year with one of our products release notes and will continue to empower our writers with components and styles to increase our CSAT scores and ultimately make our customers happy.</p>
